To add this bot to your server, use this link: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=837637318311018546&permissions=2148002880&scope=bot

To host the bot for free, I used the web server feature of replit which allowed the bot to be online even after replit is closed
To keep the server alive, I used uptime robot to ping it at constant intervals
